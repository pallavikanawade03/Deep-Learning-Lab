1. Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) Using Keras and TensorFlow
Feedforward neural networks consist of input, hidden, and output layers for tasks like classification and regression.
2. Facial Recognition Using OpenCV and Deep Learning
Binary classification of faces using OpenCV for image processing and a CNN for model training.
3. Image Classification Using CNNs
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for multiclass image classification by learning spatial hierarchies.
4. Time Series Prediction Using RNN
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) predict time series data (e.g., stock market, weather) by capturing temporal dependencies.
5. Text Identification Using OCR and Deep Learning
OpenCV and Tesseract (OCR) are used to recognize text in images, combined with deep learning for improved accuracy.
6. Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM or GRU
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks are used for analyzing the sentiment of text.
7. Object Detection Using YOLO
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a fast and accurate object detection algorithm using pretrained deep learning models.
